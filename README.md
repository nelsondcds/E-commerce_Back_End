# E-commerce_Back_End by Nelson Carlos Da Silva

This repository contains my submission for the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End. The challenge consists of building the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

If you are seeking the commits and coresponding messages from my work on this challenge, those can be found at my repository, here:
